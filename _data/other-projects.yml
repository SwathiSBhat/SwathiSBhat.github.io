  description: A Flask-based book recommender application. The recommender supports search, retrieval, marking a to-read and favorites list. A comparison of the recommendation quality was made based on collaborative filtering methods detailed in the paper <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221935859_Improving_an_Hybrid_Literary_Book_Recommendation_System_through_AuthorRanking">here</a>.

  description: Engineered a novel method for document information retrieval using bees swarm optimization guided by data mining techniques. The data mining techniques included document clustering and extraction of closed frequent itemsets using <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/44261957_Discovery_of_Frequent_Closed_Itemsets_using_Reduced_Pattern_Count_Tree">reduced-PCT (Pattern Count Tree)</a>. The resultant system had enhanced performance. <a class="underline-link" href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417417307248?via%3Dihub">Link to reference paper</a>.

  description: Built a new Linux file system where its metadata such as superblocks, block group descriptors, block group information, and directories were encrypted. This method prevents any unauthorized user from accessing any file in the filesystem. The file system intended to solve the data security problem on large data stores.
